When you set **`WORKDIR /app`** in your Dockerfile, it doesn't mean that you need to change the import paths in your code to relative imports. You can still use absolute imports (like **`from app.services import ...`**), as long as the **`app`** directory is structured correctly and the Python interpreter knows where the root of the project is.

### Explanation of Imports with `WORKDIR /app`:

1. **Absolute Imports (Preferred)**:
   - Absolute imports use the full path from the root of the Python package.
   - This is usually the best practice in Python, especially in large projects.
   - With `WORKDIR /app`, you can still use absolute imports like:
     ```python
     from app.services import data_fetch
     ```

2. **Relative Imports**:
   - Relative imports work by referring to the current directory (`.`) or the parent directory (`..`).
   - This is less commonly used and can get confusing in large projects.
   - Example of a relative import:
     ```python
     from .services import data_fetch
     ```

### How Python Finds Modules:

- **`WORKDIR`** just sets the working directory where the app will run inside the container. It doesn't affect how Python finds or loads modules.
- The **`PYTHONPATH`** includes the working directory by default, so when you run a Python script in the **`/app`** directory, Python will treat the **`/app`** folder as the root of the project.
- As long as your `app` folder is correctly structured as a package (i.e., it contains an `__init__.py` file or it's properly recognized as a package), you should continue to use **absolute imports**.

### Example Scenario with `WORKDIR /app`:

1. Your **Dockerfile** sets **`WORKDIR /app`**:
   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

2. Your folder structure might look like this:

   ```
   real_estate_service/
   ├── app/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── main.py
   │   ├── api/
   │   ├── services/
   │   └── core/
   └── requirements.txt
   ```

3. **main.py** (in `/app` folder) uses imports like:

   ```python
   from app.services.data_fetch import fetch_real_estate_data
   ```

   This absolute import will still work, even though the **`WORKDIR`** is set to `/app`, because the `app` directory is being treated as a package.

### Conclusion:
- You **do not need to switch to relative imports** (like **`from .services import ...`**) just because the **`WORKDIR`** is set to `/app`.
- Keep using **absolute imports** (like **`from app.services import ...`**) for better clarity and structure.
  
### Rebuild the Docker Image:
Once you've set **`WORKDIR /app`** in the Dockerfile, just ensure your folder structure is correct and rebuild your image:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
