If you don't specify versions at all in your **`requirements.txt`** file, the package manager (`pip`) will always install the **latest version** of each package available at the time of installation. This can be both an advantage and a risk:

### Pros of Not Specifying Versions:
1. **Always up-to-date**: You’ll always get the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches as the newest version of the package is installed.
2. **No version conflicts**: You don’t need to worry about manually managing version ranges or conflicts between specific versions of packages.

### Cons of Not Specifying Versions:
1. **Potential for Breaking Changes**: You may accidentally install breaking changes in future versions. This could cause issues if the new version introduces changes that are incompatible with your code.
2. **Unpredictable Builds**: Since package versions will change over time, the exact environment that works today may not work in the future. Without version control, it becomes harder to debug or replicate environments (especially in production).

### Flexible Alternative: Use a `requirements.txt` without Versions

Here’s what your **`requirements.txt`** would look like **without version constraints**:

```txt
fastapi
uvicorn
httpx
sqlalchemy
asyncpg
jinja2
passlib[bcrypt]
pandas
plotly
psycopg2-binary
python-dotenv
```

### Steps:
1. **Create `requirements.txt`** without specifying any versions.
2. **Install dependencies** using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Recommendation for Future-Proofing:
While not specifying versions can be convenient during development, it's a **best practice** to eventually freeze your package versions once your project is stable, especially for **production environments**. This ensures you know exactly what versions are working and can replicate the environment.

To do this, after setting up your environment, you can **freeze the versions** of all installed packages using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will capture the exact versions of all dependencies, ensuring that the environment remains consistent in the future.

### Conclusion:
- **No version specification**: Useful during initial development to always get the latest packages.
- **Version freezing**: Once the project is ready for production, it’s good to lock down versions for stability using `pip freeze`.
