Certainly! You can make the versions more flexible by specifying version ranges instead of exact versions. This allows the package manager to install any compatible versions within the specified range, which helps avoid conflicts and ensures compatibility with other dependencies.

Hereâ€™s a more flexible version of your **`requirements.txt`**:

### Flexible **`requirements.txt`**:

```txt
fastapi>=0.85.0,<1.0.0
uvicorn>=0.18.0,<1.0.0
httpx>=0.23.0,<1.0.0
sqlalchemy>=1.4.0,<2.0.0
asyncpg>=0.25.0,<1.0.0
jinja2>=3.0.0,<4.0.0
passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.0,<2.0.0
pandas>=1.4.0,<2.0.0
plotly>=5.0.0,<6.0.0
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0,<3.0.0
python-dotenv>=0.19.0,<2.0.0
```

### Explanation of Version Flexibility:
- **`fastapi>=0.85.0,<1.0.0`**: This allows any version of FastAPI from 0.85.0 up to (but not including) 1.0.0. FastAPI is a rapidly developing framework, and the 1.0.0 release may bring breaking changes.
- **`uvicorn>=0.18.0,<1.0.0`**: Similarly, you allow Uvicorn to update to any version before 1.0.0.
- For all other packages, you allow flexibility for upgrades within major versions (e.g., `>=1.4.0,<2.0.0` for SQLAlchemy and Pandas).

### Why Flexible Versions:
- **Compatibility**: Specifying ranges ensures that your app can still install compatible versions while staying within a safe range to avoid breaking changes.
- **Maintenance**: This allows you to receive minor version updates (which often include bug fixes and security patches) without being too restrictive.
  
### Installation:

Once the **`requirements.txt`** file is updated with flexible versions, you can install the packages as usual:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And for Docker, rebuild the image:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This setup should give you the flexibility you need without locking you into specific versions, while still maintaining stability in your project. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
