Exactly! When you use **volume mounting**, the container will interact directly with the local host’s filesystem, and both the container's **internal permissions** and the **local host's permissions** must be set properly.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

### 1. **Permissions Inside the Container (via Dockerfile)**
   - You need to ensure that the container's internal user (`appuser`) has write access to the mounted folder (from the local host). This is done by setting the appropriate permissions inside the **Dockerfile**.

   **Example in Dockerfile**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Create the /app/data directory and give ownership to appuser
   RUN mkdir -p /app/data && chown -R appuser:appuser /app/data
   ```

   This ensures that when the `/app/data` directory exists inside the container, it’s owned by `appuser`, allowing it to write.

### 2. **Permissions on the Local Host (because of Volume Mounting)**
   - When you mount a directory from the local host, the container uses the local host's directory as its own. Even if you set permissions correctly inside the container, the permissions on the **host** filesystem also need to allow the container’s user to write.

   **Steps to set permissions on the local host**:
   
   - Ensure the local directory (`./data`, for example) has write permissions for the user/process in the container. You can set this using `chmod` on your host:

     ```bash
     chmod -R 755 ./data
     ```

   This gives the owner of the directory full access (read, write, execute) and read/execute access to others (including the Docker container running as `appuser`).

### 3. **Ensure Both Permissions Work Together**

   In your **docker-compose.yml**, you’ll mount the directory:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./data:/app/data  # Mount local ./data folder to /app/data inside container
   ```

   This means that the `/app/data` inside the container is actually pointing to `./data` on the local host.

   - **On the container side**: `appuser` needs write access to `/app/data` (handled by `chown` in Dockerfile).
   - **On the host side**: The local directory `./data` must be writable by the container process. This is why `chmod` on the host is important.

### To Summarize:

1. **Dockerfile Permissions** (inside the container):
   - Make sure that the `appuser` inside the container has the correct permissions using `chown` and `chmod` (which you’ve already done in the Dockerfile).

2. **Host Filesystem Permissions** (local machine):
   - Set the correct permissions on the local directory (`./data`) so that the Docker container can write to it.
   - Use `chmod -R 755 ./data` to ensure the container has access.

### Conclusion:
Both **inside the container** (via Dockerfile) and on the **host machine** (via chmod), you need to ensure the appropriate permissions are set, especially when mounting volumes. This will allow the container to write to the mounted directory without any issues.
