The error you’re encountering, `starlette.routing.NoMatchFound: No route exists for name "static" and params "filename"`, indicates that **Starlette/FastAPI** is unable to find a route for serving static files, which is why the template is failing to render correctly.

This error occurs when the `url_for('static', filename='pyscript_app.py')` call in your Jinja2 template cannot find a route named `"static"` to serve your `pyscript_app.py` file.

### Solution:
You need to ensure that **static files** are correctly served in your FastAPI app by configuring a **static files route** in `main.py`.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Add Static Files Route in `main.py`**:
   In order to serve static files, FastAPI requires the use of `StaticFiles`. Update your **`main.py`** to include this:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

   app = FastAPI()

   # Serve the static folder
   app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="app/frontend/static"), name="static")
   ```

   - **`app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="app/frontend/static"), name="static")`**: This serves files from the **`app/frontend/static`** directory under the **`/static`** path. Now, when you refer to `url_for('static', filename='pyscript_app.py')`, it will be able to resolve the correct path.

2. **Update Your Template (base.html)**:
   Ensure the template code remains the same, as it’s already correctly pointing to the static route:

   ```html
   <py-script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='pyscript_app.py') }}"></py-script>
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**:
   Make sure your directory structure looks like this:

   ```
   app/
     frontend/
       static/
         pyscript_app.py
       templates/
         base.html
   ```

4. **Rebuild and Run**:
   After adding the static file route, rebuild your container if necessary and start the FastAPI app again.

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### What This Does:
- The static route allows FastAPI to serve static files from your **`static/`** directory.
- The `url_for('static', filename='pyscript_app.py')` function will now resolve correctly to `/static/pyscript_app.py`.

### Conclusion:
This should resolve the `NoMatchFound` error and allow your template to find and serve static files properly. Let me know if this works or if you need further assistance!
