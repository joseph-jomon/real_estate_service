No, you don't have to manually run `chmod +x scripts/wait-for-it.sh` every time you start a compose on a remote server. The **`chmod +x`** command just needs to be run **once** on your local machine (or in your development environment) to make the script executable. Once the script is marked as executable and included in your version control (like Git), it will retain that permission.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Mark `wait-for-it.sh` as Executable Locally**:
   - Run `chmod +x scripts/wait-for-it.sh` **once** to make the script executable.
   - After that, commit the file to your version control (Git).

2. **Docker Will Copy the Executable**:
   - When you run **`docker-compose up`** on a remote server, the Docker build process will copy the file (with the correct executable permissions) into the Docker container. 
   - You do **not** need to re-run `chmod +x` on the remote server unless you manually modify the permissions or the script.

### Professional Approach:
To make sure this works smoothly and professionally, you can ensure:
- **Version Control**: Commit the `wait-for-it.sh` script to your Git repository after setting it to be executable. This ensures that anyone cloning your repository gets the correct permissions.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  git add scripts/wait-for-it.sh
  git commit -m "Add wait-for-it.sh with executable permissions"
  git push
  ```

- **Dockerfile or Volume Binding**: If you want to ensure the executable permission is preserved across all environments (local, development, and production), you can add the `chmod +x` step directly to the **Dockerfile**.

### Adding to Dockerfile:
If you want to **ensure** the script always has the right permissions when copied into the container, you can add the `chmod` step in the **Dockerfile**. This way, you won’t need to worry about manual intervention.

Example in **Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Copy the wait-for-it.sh script into the container
COPY ./scripts/wait-for-it.sh /scripts/wait-for-it.sh

# Ensure the script has executable permissions
RUN chmod +x /scripts/wait-for-it.sh
```

### Final `docker-compose.yml` Example:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    container_name: real_estate_app_debug
    command: ["/scripts/wait-for-it.sh", "db:5432", "--", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@db/your_db_name
    volumes:
      - ./data/images:/app/data/images

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    container_name: real_estate_db_debug
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: your_db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_db_password
      POSTGRES_DB: your_db_name
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

### Conclusion:
- You only need to run `chmod +x` once locally. After that, the permissions are retained and stored in your version control.
- For production or remote servers, Docker will handle the script with the right permissions if it’s correctly set and version-controlled.
- You can make this even more robust by adding the `chmod +x` step to your Dockerfile to ensure it always has the correct permissions, regardless of the environment.

This is a professional way to handle this without needing to run `chmod` on every remote deployment. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!
